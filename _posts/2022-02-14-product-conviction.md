Many times before planning the year ahead, next quarter or even the next sprint I always have a long list of ideas that my team can work on. <!--more-->
I experimented with several processes that can help me pick, validate, polish and prioritise next deliverables for my team. 

Over the years I have realised,  it always work best if my team already knows there is a thoughtful and meaningful process in place that will help us validate the ideas we should work on next. It has following benefits -

### 1. My team keeps me grounded, they know we follow a certain process to quantify the potential of an idea
### 2. It’s becomes easier to get stakeholder’s buy ins
### 3. Saves from making inconsistent tradeoff decisions
### 4. Prevents late stage blow off, when we forget why we were doing this in the first place
### 5. Helps with staying on track and under budget since now the team understand what is the focus.

Here is the approach I follow with my team to build a strong sense of product conviction. For each idea that is worth my time, I take four steps to build a strong case. 

### 1. I start with understanding the Customer Value
### 2. Understanding the business impact
### 3. Getting a good sense of efforts required
### 4. Aligning with my leaders and key stakeholders
